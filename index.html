                <h5>Sky Garden</h5>
                <p>I want to build a vertical garden that rivals a skyscraper in height. 
                    The garden should produce it's own energy and clean water. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    All crops should be cared for and harvested by robotic gardeners.
                    The buildings utilities should be operated intelligently using software and hardware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The exterior of the structure should be hardened to protect against solar flares.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>data driven reality tv</h5>
                <p>
                    What if we created reality style entertainment that was derived from human 
                    digital interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make story lines based from data analysis.
