        <h1>Aaron Pankratz</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm writing this so that you can learn more about me and what it's like to work with me. Think of this as a README for my professional self.</p>
        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>First and formost I'm an engineer. I love to read/write code, work with data, and build things! I'm also a software and systems architect, technical lead, mediator between engineers and stakeholders, part time manager, and engineering mentor.</p>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>I started learning about computers from an early age. MS-DOS, Mario teaches typing, and the Lemmings video game were my earliest exposures to computing. My grandfather was an engineer and taught me some basics of HTML. My father was a software engineer for 31+ years. He worked on programming hard real-time operating systems and data processing systems for mission critical applications and taught me computers, typing, the internet, and programming.</p>
        <p>I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with my B.S. in Computer Science and since then I've been working on full-stack web applications. I've worked as an iOS mobile developer. I've built an mobile app for a startup from scratch using React Native while also working full-stack. Since 2020 I've been working on building SOA, scalable micro service systems and focusing on back end technologies.</p>
        </p>I've worked at a variety of companies, including startups from 5-50 people, mid-size companies from 100-5000 people, and a large tech company with 50,000+ people. I've learned many lessons and patterns from all the different people and technologies I've worked with. I enjoy the challenge of mentoring. I've mentored more than a dozen people from all experience levels, high school students and software apprentices to senior engineers.</p>
        <h3>Working style</h3>
        <p>I've been working remotely since 2018.</p>
        <p>Early mornings for me are for focused work. I block off the first 2-3 hours of my day to focus on writing/reviewing code, technical specs, scoping projects and executing high priority tasks. I ignore all communication channels and distractions during this time so that I can maximize my flow state and maintain peak productivity levels. If you don't get a response from me during this time, please be patient, I promise I'll get back to you.</p>
        <p>Late morning through the rest of the day, I'm responding to chat, email and meeting with engineers, stakeholders, and managers to collaborate. If I have any gaps without meetings I work on various low priority tasks.</p>
        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>My DISC Type is C, analyst. I tend to be an objective thinker and prioritize accuracy and results. I pay attention to small details and take a systematic aproach to solving problems. I naturally enjoy experimenting with many solutions to a problem. I get energy from order and organization. Unreliable, unproven information drains me.</p>
        <p>At work my personality shifts toward SC, stabilizer. I thrive when establishing consistent daily routines, creating stability, predictability, and trust. I value careful planning and preparation.</p>
        <p>My top five Gallup Clifton strengths are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Learner: Learning new skills and information is one of my favorite things to do.</p></li>
            <li><p>Achiever: I'm highly motivated by acheiving a goal which plays into my results oriented mindset.</p></li>
            <li><p>Analytical: I have an analytical mindset and I typically want to understand all the options and information before making a decision.</p></li>
            <li><p>Intellection: I enjoy discussing big ideas, puzzles, problems, and strategies.</p></li>
            <li><p>Self-Assurance: I don't get too anxious about things and tend to stay optimistic, assuming everything will work out. I don't mind being the first to be vulnerable in a group to help others open up.</p></li>
        </ul>
