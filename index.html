        <h1>Aaron Pankratz</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm writing this so that you can learn more about me and what it's like to work with me. Think of this as a README for my professional self.</p>
        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>First and foremost I'm an engineer. I love to read and write code, work with data, and build things! I'm passionate about software and systems architecture, technical leadership, cross-functional collaboration, and engineering mentorship. I enjoy learning about business, finance, and startups. I love to garden, play music, throw ceramics (if you're not familiar, throwing is making ceramics on a pottery wheel), exercise, spend time in nature, and read.</p>
        <p>I love coffee and breakfast tacos!</p>
        <h3>Education and Experience</h3>
        <p>I started learning about computers from an early age. MS-DOS, Mario teaches typing, and the Lemmings video game were my earliest exposures to computing. My grandfather was an engineer and taught me some basics of HTML. My father was a software engineer for 31+ years before retiring, and taught me computers, typing, the internet, and programming.</p>
        <p>I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with my B.S. in Computer Science and since then I've been working as a Software Engineer on full-stack web applications. I've worked as an iOS developer. I've built systems and mobile apps from ground zero to production, while leading teams of engineers and contributing in all parts of the stack. Recently, I've been building service oriented, scalable systems and focusing on back end technologies.</p>
        </p>I've been incredibly blessed with the opportunities to work at a variety of companies, including a few startups (from 5 to 50 people), mid-size companies (from 100 to 5000 people), and even a very large tech company (with 50,000+ people). I've learned many lessons and patterns from all the different people and technologies I've worked with.</p>
        <p>I enjoy the challenge of mentoring. I've mentored more than a dozen people from all experience levels, high school students and software apprentices to senior engineers.</p>
        <p>I think there is always more to learn, and I'm humbled daily by the experience and knowledge of those around me.</p>
        <h3>Working style</h3>
        <p>I lead by example through action. I prefer to show rather than tell. I'm always willing to pair program. I try to help as much as I can. I prefer to delegate at a high level, and I'm also happy to meet someone where they are at and teach. When I'm running a meeting, I want us to communicate and hear what everyone is thinking. I'll make the extra effort to give everyone a chance to speak up.</p>
        <p>I've been working remotely since 2018.</p>
        <p>Early mornings for me are for focused work. I block off the first hours of my day to focus on writing and reviewing code, technical specs, scoping projects and executing high priority tasks. I turn off all distractions during this time so that I can maximize my flow state and maintain my productivity. If I don't respond immediately, please be patient, I promise I'll get back to you!</p>
        <p>Late morning through the rest of the day, I'm responding to chat, email and meeting with engineers, stakeholders, and managers to collaborate. If I have any gaps without meetings I work on various low urgency tasks.</p>
        <p>Of course, things can change day to day and sometimes my responsibilities require me to drop everything to take action fielding and debugging urgent issues. However, most of the time my schedule goes as described above.</p>
        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>My DISC Type is C, analyst. I tend to be an objective thinker and prioritize accuracy and results. I pay attention to small details and take a systematic aproach to solving problems. I naturally enjoy experimenting with many solutions to a problem. I get energy from order and organization. Unreliable, unproven information drains me.</p>
        <p>At work my personality shifts toward SC, stabilizer. I thrive when establishing consistent daily routines, creating stability, predictability, and trust. I value careful planning and preparation.</p>
        <p>My top five Gallup Clifton strengths are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Learner: Learning new skills and information is one of my favorite things to do.</p></li>
            <li><p>Achiever: I'm highly motivated by acheiving a goal which plays into my results oriented mindset.</p></li>
            <li><p>Analytical: I have an analytical mindset and I typically want to understand all the options and information before making a decision.</p></li>
            <li><p>Intellection: I enjoy discussing big ideas, puzzles, problems, and strategies.</p></li>
            <li><p>Self-Assurance: I don't get too anxious about things and tend to stay optimistic, assuming everything will work out. I don't mind being the first or last to speak in a group.</p></li>
        </ul>
