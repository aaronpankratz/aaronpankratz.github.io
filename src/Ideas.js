                I like ideas. Somtimes just sitting around and thinking can be fun. Some feel original but I believe that most of the time my ideas are a reflection of things I learn from my surroundings.

                            <p>I want to build a vertical garden that rivals a skyscraper in height. 
                                The garden should produce it's own energy and clean water. 
                                All crops should be cared for and harvested by robotic gardeners (maybe drones).
                                The buildings utilities should be operated intelligently using software and hardware.</p>
